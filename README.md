# System and Decision-Making Methods in Python

This project focuses on the implementation of various system and decision-making methods using Python. It aims to explore how these methods can be applied in real-world scenarios, providing insights into data analysis, modeling, and decision support systems.

## Features

- **System Methods**:
  - Implementation of system dynamics models for simulating complex systems.
  - Use of optimization algorithms for resource allocation and management.

- **Decision-Making Methods**:
  - Implementation of decision trees and rule-based systems for classification tasks.
  - Multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) techniques for evaluating alternatives.
  - Visualization tools for decision support and analysis.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib (for data handling and visualization)
